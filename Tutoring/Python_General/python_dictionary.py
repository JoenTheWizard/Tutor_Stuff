#I will give you a file later (python_dictionary.txt), it will contain a large list of names and values.
#Here is an example of what a line of this file would look like

#Bob : 20, 30, 10, 4 (Some of the scores list may vary in length)
#So Bob should be the key. And its corresponding values should be { mean: 16 }
#So the resulting value should be { 'Bob' : { mean : 16 } }

#Optional: 
#At the end of the program it should return the person with the highest 'mean' value
#If for example 'Bob' had the highest mean, at the end print this
#"Bob has the highest mean value"
